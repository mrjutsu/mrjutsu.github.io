            Ruby is the language I fell in love with and the one that inspired me to become a Web Developer. It all started when
            I learned that sites like Twitter and GitHub were built using Ruby, it made me curious and inspired me to take beginner
            courses. When taking those courses I noticed how simple and powerful Ruby is. It's now the language I have more experience
            with and the one I'm constantly thriving to improve. I use it to develop projects from the first model and up to deployment.
            It also allowed me to make my very own gem.

            When developing, you need to know what changes have been made to your code, who did it and when that person did it,
            that's where SCM software comes in hand. I've been working with Git since I started learning Ruby and Rails, it's
            a software that makes my life easier when I need to save my progress and manage versions of my projects in order.

            I have a few months of experience with HTML, mostly working with semanthic markup for my personal projects,
            giving the HTML structure a cleaner look and also making it work more efficiently.

            Throughout the time I've been working with Rails I've also worked with jQuery to modify the DOM as needed and
            use AJAX requests to fetch information without reloading the page. I have to admit it's a delight working with
            this library.

          Hello, I'm David Rosillo, Multimedia Engineer and Web Developer. I was born in Barranquilla, Colombia in 1991. Since I was a child I was always interested in technology,
          software and video games, I was always in the computer, learning how the OS worked and how to customize it as much as I
          could. Back then I felt like an expert when I managed to fix something that didn't work.
        </p>
        <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6 whitey">
          After school I studied Multimedia Engineering in Cali, a warm and happy city in Colombia. At the university I learned how
          to code with languages like Java, ActionScript and MATLAB. However, it was after I graduated that I joined a bootcamp
          in Bogotá, there I learned Ruby and Rails. It changed my entire life.
