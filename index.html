            Ruby is the language I fell in love with and the one that inspired me to become a Web Developer.
            I've been developing and maintaining work and personal projects for over a year with Ruby, it's the language
            I'm more experienced with and the one I'm always striving to master. Ruby is the simplest, yet the most powerful
            language I've known so far.

          <p class="skill-p">
            When developing, you need to know what changes have been made to your code, who did it and when that person did it,
            that's where SCM software comes in hand. I've been working with Git since I started learning Ruby and Rails, it's
            a software that makes my life easier when I need to save my progress and manage versions of my projects in order.

            <strong>HTML5</strong><br>
            I have a few months of experience with HTML, mostly working with semanthic markup for my personal projects,
            giving the HTML structure a cleaner look and also making it work more efficiently.<br><br>
            <strong>jQuery</strong><br>
            Throughout the time I've been working with Rails I've also worked with jQuery to modify the DOM as needed and
            use AJAX requests to fetch information without reloading the page. I have to admit it's a delight working with
            this library.<br><br>
            <strong>CSS3</strong><br>
            CSS gave me the freedom and power to style my projects as I wanted, not only desktop devices, but to mobile devices
            as well, creating responsive sites that addapt to any screen and can be seen perfectly by users in any device.<br><br>
            <strong>AngularJS</strong><br>
            The most recent entry in my list of skills. AngularJS caught my eye when I read in several web sites how easy it
            was to make a fully functional front end from a web app. It's been a couple of months now working and constantly
            learning new things about AngularJS, and currently my plans don't involve stopping.

          My name is David Rosillo and I was born in Barranquilla, Colombia in 1991. Since I was a child I was always interested in technology,
          software and video games, I was always in the computer, learning how the OS worked and how to customize it as much as I
          could. Back then I felt like an expert when I managed to fix something that didn't work.
        </p>
        <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
          After school I studied Multimedia Engineering in Cali, a warm and happy city in Colombia. At the university I learned how
          to code with languages like Java, ActionScript and MATLAB. However, it was after I graduated that I joined a bootcamp
          in Bogotá, there I learned Ruby and Rails. It changed my entire life.
